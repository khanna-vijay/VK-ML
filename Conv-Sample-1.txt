Conversation Between Two Friends Who Meet in a Restaurant

Mira – Hey Radha? Is it you?

Radha– Oh Mira! How are you? It’s been a long time.

Mira – I am fine, what about you? Yes, we last met during the board exams.

Radha– I’m good too.

Mira – What are you doing now?

Radha– Well, I have started my undergraduate studies in English Honours at St. Xaviers College in Mumbai.

Mira – Wow! You finally got to study the subject you loved the most in school.

Radha– True. What about you Mira? Wasn’t History your favourite subject?

Mira – You guessed it right. I took up History Honours in Lady Shri Ram College for Women in Delhi.

Radha– That’s nice. I am so happy for you.

Mira – I am happy for you too. Let’s meet up again soon.

Radha– Yes, sure! We have a lot to catch up on.

Mira – Bye for now. I have to pick up my sister from tuition. Take care.

Radha– Bye, will see you soon.
